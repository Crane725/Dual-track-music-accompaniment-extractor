# Dual-track-music-accompaniment-extractor
Based on band-elimination filter and dual track. Only tested on several japanese pop music.<br>
Make sure the original music file is in .wav form.<br>
If you want to use it at other music, the bandwidth area may need mild adjustment.<br>
Anyone sees it has the rights for copying, learning, modifying and spreading but no illegal utilizing is allowed like criminal ways.<br>
If anyone has better ideas in this project please touch me in cranekiyoe229@sjtu.edu.cn, 957796480@qq.com or cranezhy@gmail.com. I really appreciate that.
